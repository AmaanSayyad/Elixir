# Elixir

The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has been rapidly evolving in recent years, with new tokens and platforms constantly emerging. One of the most interesting innovations in this space has been the elastic supply token, which adjusts its supply based on market conditions to maintain a stable price. Inspired by the success of Ampleforth, set out to create an advanced elastic supply token called Elixir.

Elixir is a Stacks version 2 token with an elastic supply that works seamlessly with Swapr, a decentralized exchange built on the Stacks blockchain. The token incentivizes liquidity providers with token rewards and rebates daily based on a price Oracle. Elixir can be transferred and exchanged on Swapr, and users can earn rewards by providing liquidity on Swapr and staking their liquidity token on the Geyser.
